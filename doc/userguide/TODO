Intro
  description of v3

Installation
  update version number

Governing equations
  quick check
  add note on poroelasticity implementation

PyLith design
  Update diagram (no FIAT)
  Fields with subfields
  Solution field (displacement/velocity, displacement/pressure, etc)
  Auxiliary field with subfields (properties and state variables)
  Basis order and quadrature
    Basis order can differ among subfields, but quadrature order
      cannot (for now)
  Organization of components
    physics (materials, boundary conditions, interface conditions) and
   physics implementations (integrators and constraints)

    physics provide kernels, auxiliary field, derived field
    integrators perform integrations or apply constraints
