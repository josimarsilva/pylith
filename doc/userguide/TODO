PyLith design
  Update diagram (no FIAT)
  Fields with subfields
  Solution field (displacement/velocity, displacement/pressure, etc)
    Predefined containers
    
  Auxiliary field with subfields (properties and state variables)
  Basis order and quadrature
    Basis order can differ among subfields, but quadrature order
      cannot (for now)
  Organization of components
    physics (materials, boundary conditions, interface conditions) and
   physics implementations (integrators and constraints)

    physics provide kernels, auxiliary field, derived field
    integrators perform integrations or apply constraints
