# Examples: 3-D Subduction Zone

**IMPORTANT**: THIS EXAMPLE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR V3.0.

The examples in this directory form a step-by-step sequence of 8
problems involving a 3-D subduction zone. In general, each example
builds on the previous one. All of the examples use the same mesh,
generated using CUBIT/Trelis.

See the PyLith User Manual for a detailed discussion of these examples.
